# Clothes-Size-Fitting-Detection
This module implements a real-time clothing size estimation and virtual try-on system using human pose landmarks extracted from a video frame. The primary goal of the system is to accurately estimate upper-body clothing dimensions and overlay a clothing image onto a person in a natural and stable manner.
